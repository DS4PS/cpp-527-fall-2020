# Review Sessions 

Live review sessions will be held each week in order to: 

* Discuss solutions to labs from the previous week 
* Introduce new topics 
* Answer questions on the the current week's lab 

> **Wednesdays, 4pm AZ time**  
> [**ZOOM MEETING LINK**](https://asu.zoom.us/j/93504639301)  

To make the best use of sessions I recommend starting labs ahead of time so that you can come with questions. 

For those that cannot attend recordings of each session will be posted below. 

Feel free to schedule virtual office hours as well.
